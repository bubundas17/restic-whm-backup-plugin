Plugin Icon Placeholder

For a proper plugin installation, replace this file with a proper icon:

1. Create a 48x48 pixel PNG icon named "restic_backup.png"
2. Place it in this directory
3. Make sure it's readable by the web server (chmod 644)

The icon will be displayed in the WHM and cPanel interfaces.
